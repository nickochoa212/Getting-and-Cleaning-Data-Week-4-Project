# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Week-4-Project
#####There is just one script in the repo to perform all of the tidying and analysis.
#####The script is called run_analysis.R

#####To make the script work for your data, you will just need to modify Line 14 so that the appropriate working directory is set for your R Studio.  You should point to the folder that contains the folder "UCI HAR Dataset"

#####After running the script, you will have a set of data in your workspace.  The important ones are 'analysis' and 'df', which are both data frames.
#####'df' is the result of steps 1-4 of the project.  It is a tidy version of 'training' and 'test' datasets from the raw UCI data.
#####'analysis' is the result of step 5 of the project. It is a tidy data frame that contains the means of each variable for each subject and each activity, as asked for in the project.
